The main difference is when a generator function is called and compiled they become an object that supports an iteration protocol. That means when they are called they don't actually return a value and then exit, the generator functions will automatically suspend and resume their execution and state around the last point of value generation. \n","\n","The main advantage here is \"state suspension\" which means, instead of computing an entire series of values upfront and the generator functions can be suspended.
